            <div id = "contentTitle" class = "listTitle" style = "font-style: italic;">About hivemind:</div>
            <div id = "aboutText1" class = "aboutText" style = "font-weight: 500;">
                Regarding the origins of the app: 
            </div>
            <div id = "aboutText2" class = "aboutText" style = "margin: 0;">
                The story of this app begins with getting asked one too many times about what homework was assigned for a class and a thought that went something like this: “Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a way to create a list of things to do that you could share with other people so that everyone can contribute to the list… but in a way that allows you to personalize and keep the changes made to the list relevant to what you need to do?” And thus, the idea of an app that allows you to create “collaborative” task lists was born.
            </div>
            <div id = "aboutText3" class = "aboutText" style = "font-weight: 500; margin-top: 5%;">
                Regarding the general use of the app: 
            </div>
            <div id = "aboutText4" class = "aboutText" style = "margin: 0;">
                A user can “join” a task list another user creates with a join code (composed of the user's choice of input and up to four random digits), which essentially means the user gains a personal copy of the task list, to which they can make changes without directly affecting other copies of the task list. Each user with a copy of a task list can see what changes other users make to their copies of the task list and may opt to disregard those changes or make those changes to their copy of the task list.
